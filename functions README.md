# Inductance_calculator, I prgogrammed this calculator to help you calculate the inductance of an inductor which was created by you.
While you create your inductor coil, take note of:
-Area of the coil former (e.g iron core, ferrite or plastic) so long as it is tubuler
-length of the coil
-Number of turns
  With this infor, you can place it in the output of the code and you will be able to get the inductance of your home made inductor coil, in (henry)H
